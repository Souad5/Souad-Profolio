          About Me
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Hi, Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold">Md Souad Al Kabir</span>, a passionate
          and dedicated full stack web developer. My journey started with curiosity
          about how websites work, and over time, I mastered technologies like HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          I enjoy building dynamic and responsive web applications. My favorite part
          is problem-solving and creating smooth user experiences. I continuously
          strive to learn and improve every day.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Beyond coding, I love playing sports, watching tech videos, and exploring
          new tools in the software world. I believe consistency, curiosity, and
          creativity are key to growth.
